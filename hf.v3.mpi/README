Incremental transformation to derive the MPI version.

We will parallelize in exactly the same way as the OpenMP version


1) Introduce MPIInit and Finalize get rid of excess print and guard
   all remaining print statements with if(rank==0)

2) broadcast command line argument to all processes 

   [here assume that everyone will have access to the file using the
   same name ... not usually a valid assumption]


Exercises

 - repeat the parallelization starting from the sequential version
